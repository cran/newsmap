# Newsmap: geographical news classifier

Semi-supervised Bayesian model for geographical document classification.
Its [online version](http://newsmap.koheiw.net) has been working since
2011. It has first been in Python, but recently implemented in R. This
program automatically construct a large geographical dictionary from a
corpus of news stories for accurate classification. Currently, the
**newsmap** package contains seed dictionaries for *English*, *German*,
*French*, *Spanish*, *Russian*, *Italian*, *Japanese*, *Chinese*
documents.

The detail of the algorithm is explained in [Newsmap: semi-supervised
approach to geographical news
classification](http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/dDeyUTBrhxBSSkHPn5uB/full).
**newsmap** has also been used in recent social scientific studies:

## How to install

**newsmap** is available on CRAN since the version 0.6. You can install
the package using R Studio GUI or the command.

``` r
install.packages("newsmap")
```

If you want to the latest version, please install by running this
command in R. You need to have **devtools** installed beforehand.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("koheiw/newsmap")
```

## Example

In this example, using a text analysis package
[**quanteda**](https://quanteda.io) for preprocessing of textual data,
we train a geographical classification model on a [corpus of news
summaries collected from Yahoo
News](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e19kslwhuu9yc2z/yahoo-news.RDS?dl=1) via
RSS in
2014.

| text68 | Up to $1,000 a day to care for child migrants. More than 57,000 unaccompanied children, mostly from Central America, have been caught entering the country illegally since last October, and President Barack Obama has asked for $3.7 billion in emergency funding to address what he has called an “urgent humanitarian solution.” “One of the figures that sticks in everybody’s mind is we’re paying about $250 to $1,000 per child,” Senator Jeff Flake told reporters, citing figures presented at a closed-door briefing by Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Federal authorities are struggling to find more cost-effective housing, medical care, counseling and legal services for the undocumented minors. The base cost per bed was $250 per day, including other services, Senator Dianne Feinstein said, without providing details. | us      |

| text73 | 1,000 killed in Boko Haram conflict this year. More than 1,000 people have been killed so far this year in three states in northeastern Nigeria worst hit by Boko Haram violence, according to the country’s main relief organisation. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) figures are the starkest indication yet of the increase in bloodshed in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe that have caused growing concern. NEMA said in a presentation in Abuja on Tuesday that people living in the states were “caught up in an intensifying conflict”, which has been raging since 2009. Violence has increased in northeastern Nigeria since the new year, including a high-profile attack on a boarding school in Yobe, which saw dozens of students slaughtered in their beds.                                                                       | ng      |
